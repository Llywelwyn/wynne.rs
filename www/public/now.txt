what would i tell somebody i haven't seen in a year

i'm in the middle of buying a house. our solicitors are
talking to their solicitors and there's no chain, so it
looks like things will move quickly. it took us about 6
months to get to this point though!

i'm working as an engineer. i work with a client in the
voluntary sector mostly. i maintain a site used to hook
people in need up with services that can help them. its
old and full of legacy code but it's getting there

i also dyed my hair again, and i'm blonde now

cheers,
lew

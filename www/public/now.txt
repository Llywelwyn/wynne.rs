what would i tell somebody i haven't seen in a year

right now i'm in the middle of buying a house,
we've just received the memorandum of sale after
six months or so of waiting for the seller to
find something they like

i'm working as an engineer. most of my time is
with a client in the voluntary sector. i maintain
a site used to refer people in need to the services
that can help them. it's old and full of legacy
code, but it's getting there

right now i'm writing this from a bar at just shy
of 1am, as a distraction from finishing my dnd prep

cheers,
lew

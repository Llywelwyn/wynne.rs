what would i tell somebody i haven't seen in a year

right now i'm in the middle of buying a house,
though i'm at the start really. it's been waiting
more than anything. the couple we're buying from
are looking for something perfect and we're happy
to wait. but hopefully soon things will move

waiting for the house has put most things on hold
i don't want to join clubs where i am currently because
i wont be here soon(hopefully)

i'm working as an engineer. most of my time is
with a client in the voluntary sector. i maintain
a site used to refer people in need to the services
that can help them. it's old and full of legacy
code, but it's getting there now that i'm working
with it essentially full time

i spend 14 or so hours a week mentoring kid programmers,
where i teach mostly python. some javascript too

cheers,
lew

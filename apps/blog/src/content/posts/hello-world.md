i've always kept my projects online and public, and i've always had some sort of homepage. it was originally bebo, then some sites i made through school, then facebook.

:right[i liked farmville but otherwise didnt use facebook much]

my next site after that was one that i kept updated for years. but every time i updated it, i also tacked on features i liked, and then ultimately it became a mess of ideas. it was never suppoesd to be well-engineered, but i like clean code and i ended up too busy fixing things to do anything new or interesting

so i deleted everything i could think of that was even remotely fancy and made this

there's one bit of javascript on this site, and that's the [/random](https://wynne.rs/random/) route to take you to a random page

everything else is mostly vanilla. there's no pagination or searching, though i did add categorisation

plain text files are hosted and indexed at [/txt](https://wynne.rs/txt/),

longer form things are in categories at [/md](https://wynne.rs/txt/),

there are [/bookmarks](https://wynne.rs/bookmarks/) for things that link elsewhere,

and there's a [/guestbook](https://wynne.rs/guestbook/) that used to have placeable stickers and selectable card backgrounds, and hand-drawn art and pagination, and a gallery section where people could paint pictures, and... is now just a list of names and the text that was left, which i prefer

:right[the old guestbook still exists; its just not the one i link anymore]

in the end, everything on this site is visible straight from the index page in one massive list, ordered by date, with pinned posts at the top of their respective category.

and that's it. i don't need anything else to archive things i care about

cheers,
